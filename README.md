# Cobrowse.io - Android Native SDK

Cobrowse.io for Android supports API 19 (4.4 KitKat) and above.

Cobrowse.io is 100% free and easy to try out in your own apps. Please see full documentation at [https://cobrowse.io/docs](https://cobrowse.io/docs).

Try our **online demo** at the bottom of our homepage at <https://cobrowse.io/#tryit>.

*Enterprise customers may access full source code and self-host upon request.*

## Installation

**In your app build.gradle**
```gradle
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies ...
    implementation 'io.cobrowse:cobrowse-sdk-android:2.+'
}
```

To use Cobrowse.io in your project, please add the following lines to your Application subclass.

```java
package com.example;

import android.app.Application;
import io.cobrowse.CobrowseIO;

public class MainApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        CobrowseIO.instance().license("<your license key here>");
        CobrowseIO.instance().start(this);
    }
}
```

**Important:** Make sure you do this in your custom Application subclass `onCreate()` to ensure devices register in your dashboard right away.

You may also start CobrowseIO in your MainActivity or other Activity if necessary. In that case, the SDK will continue to function even as new Activities are being created and destroyed. 

### Add your license key

Please register an account and generate your free License Key at <https://cobrowse.io/dashboard/settings>.

This will associate sessions from your mobile app with your Cobrowse.io account.


### Add device metadata

To help you identify, search, and filter devices in your Cobrowse dashboard, it's helpful to specify any meaningful metadata.

You may add any custom key/value pairs you'd like, and they will all be searchable and filterable in your online dashboard. We've added a few placeholders for convenience only - all fields are optional.

```java
package com.example;

import android.app.Application;
import io.cobrowse.CobrowseIO;

public class MainApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        CobrowseIO.instance().license("<your license key here>");

        Log.i("App", "Cobrowse device id: " + CobrowseIO.instance().deviceId(this));

        HashMap<String, Object> customData = new HashMap<>();
        customData.put(CobrowseIO.USER_ID_KEY, "<your_user_id>");
        customData.put(CobrowseIO.USER_NAME_KEY, "<your_user_name>");
        customData.put(CobrowseIO.USER_EMAIL_KEY, "<your_user_email>");
        customData.put(CobrowseIO.DEVICE_ID_KEY, "<your_device_id>");
        customData.put(CobrowseIO.DEVICE_NAME_KEY, "<your_device_name>");
        CobrowseIO.instance().customData(customData);

        CobrowseIO.instance().start(this);
    }
}
```
